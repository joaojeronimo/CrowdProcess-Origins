## "Oh no, its that cloud computing talk again" and the Spark

I know the exact day I had the spark, because I was in a [conference](http://congresso10.apdc.pt/) in a [talk about cloud computing](http://congresso10.apdc.pt/Programa/Tema.aspx?tema_id=9A4A99D6-B96F-46D1-AE0D-C00AB8A7139D&tema_label=SERVICES:%20Cloud%20Computing). The panel was named "How Cloud Computing Changes Everything" so I thought I had to see what they had to say. Most of the talks were about what vendors (who by some coincidence were sponsoring the conference) had to offer, so not exactly new stuff. I had seen similar talks on youtube, read enough about the topic, and already spinned off some EC2 instances to play with a project that had to do with Page Rank and Graph Theory. It was 2010, cloud computing was not exactly a new thing and it wasn't changing everything, it already had.

But I was in the middle of the row, and it would be rude to leave in the middle. I was kind of stuck.

So to pass the time I started thinking what could I bring to the table, if anything, and if possible, change everything again. I like challenges.

In one of the talks, [Miguel Milano](http://congresso10.apdc.pt/Orador/Orador.aspx?orador_id=A8AECA70-9FB1-4793-8126-4DB68F11F376) from Oracle, showed the famous video of [Larry Ellison bashing the term "Cloud Computing"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEFXaWHppE). He's right. Cloud computing is old, possibly as old as the internet. And I remembered Distributed Computing projects like [Folding@home](http://folding.stanford.edu/) and [SETI@Home](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/), those are clouds, those are CPUs and GPUs connected and working towards a common goal, and they've been around since 2000 and 1999 respectively. I only new the two at the time, and I thought to myself "well, these projects run on volunteers, could their processing pool get bigger if the hardware owners got paid ?".

So this was the spark, I know, very disappointing. But that's when it all started, and all the rest was brainstormming and refining the idea.

I later found out that there were actually a few companied paying PC owners for computing power, that those were the smaller processing power pools, that there was already a graveyard of companies who tried to do it before, that that model did not exactly work because the electricity costs were sometimes greater or equal to the benefits of harnessing the CPU power, and that it was hard to aquire CPU power suppliers one by one.

Pretty upsetting, but then again, I like challenges.
